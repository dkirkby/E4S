# E4S: Electronics for Scientists

Material for a [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/) course offered by the [Department of Physics Astronomy](https://www.physics.uci.edu/) and taught by [David Kirkby](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/dkirkby/).

## Equipment

This course uses a [standard component kit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fDZMHFTLSX1ApLEP1mGgGuPPSofG94EePxDg_fpRnkw/edit#gid=0) whose total cost is about US$200.  There are two components (9V supply, AC relay) that assume North American AC power.

Most of the components are designed and manufactured by [adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/about) which provides excellent [supporting documentation and tutorials](https://learn.adafruit.com/).

## Projects

1. [Digital Multimeter](projects/DMM.md)

## CircuitPython Libraries

Some of the components in the kit need additional [libaries to be installed](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/circuitpython-libraries):
