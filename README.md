# E4S: Electronics for Scientists

*Material for a [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/) course offered by the [Department of Physics Astronomy](https://www.physics.uci.edu/) and developed by [David Kirkby](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/dkirkby/).*

## Equipment

This course uses a standard component kit for each student whose total cost is about US$200 and fits comfortably in a 6-quart plastic storage box, weighing about ?? g.

Many of the components are designed and manufactured by [adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/about) which provides excellent [supporting documentation and tutorials](https://learn.adafruit.com/).

The two included [microcontroller boards](Pico.md) are programmable and require some initial setup: instructions are [here](setup.md).

For basic examples that demonstrate each of the kit's components, start [here](hello.md).
