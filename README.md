# E4S: Electronics for Scientists

Material for a UC Irvine course offered by Department of Physics Astronomy.

## Equipment

This course uses a [standard component kit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fDZMHFTLSX1ApLEP1mGgGuPPSofG94EePxDg_fpRnkw/edit#gid=0) whose total cost is about US$200.  There are two components (9V supply, AC relay) that assume North American AC power.

Most of the components are designed and manufactured by [adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/about) which provides excellent [supporting documentation and tutorials](https://learn.adafruit.com/).
