# E4S: Electronics for Scientists

Material for a [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/) course offered by the [Department of Physics Astronomy](https://www.physics.uci.edu/) and taught by [David Kirkby](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/dkirkby/).

## Equipment

This course uses a [standard component kit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fDZMHFTLSX1ApLEP1mGgGuPPSofG94EePxDg_fpRnkw/edit#gid=0) whose total cost is about US$200:

There are two components (9V supply, AC relay) that assume North American AC power.  The kit's jumper wires and cables are not shown in the photo.  If you are ordering components yourself, there is some soldering required to attach headers (as noted in the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fDZMHFTLSX1ApLEP1mGgGuPPSofG94EePxDg_fpRnkw/edit#gid=0)).

The kit fits comfortably in a 6 quart plastic storage box and weighs about 2.0 pounds.

Most of the components are designed and manufactured by [adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/about) which provides excellent [supporting documentation and tutorials](https://learn.adafruit.com/).

The three included microcontroller boards (2 x Metro M4 and a Pi Pico) are programmable and require some initial setup: instructions are [here](setup.md).
