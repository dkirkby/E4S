# E4S Kit

*Material for a [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/) course offered by the [Department of Physics Astronomy](https://www.physics.uci.edu/) and developed by [David Kirkby](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/dkirkby/).*

Welcome to your **Electronics for Scientists** kit!  Your kit should include a page of the images below, showing each component at full size (but you can also download the PDF [here](img/kit.pdf)):

To get started, place one of each component over its image. Most components are easily distinguised except for the 1μF and 0.1μF capacitors: look for a "K" marking on the 1μF capacitor.

## Passive Linear Components

- 2 x 10KΩ resistors
- 2 x 1KΩ resistors
- 1 x 50Ω resistor
- 1 x NTC thermistor
- 1 x 470μF electrolytic capacitor
- 1 x 1μF capacitor (looks similar to the 0.1μF but has a "K" marking)
- 1 x 0.1μF capacitor (no "K" marking)

## Optoelectronic Components

- 1 x red LED
- 1 x green LED
- 4 x IR LED + photodiode pair
