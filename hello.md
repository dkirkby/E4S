# Hello Examples

Each component in your kit has a corresponding example with a name like `hello_neo.py`. Use these as a starting point for learning the basic usage of a component and developing your own code.

You can browse all examples [here](https://github.com/dkirkby/E4S/tree/main/hello).

Some examples might refer to components that are no longer in the kits, such as the Metro M4 microcontroller and the power relay module.
