# Digital Communications

Imagine that you need to send a value 0-7 from one circuit to another. Assume that both circuits have the same power and ground levels.

1. Devise a fast way to transmit a value 0-7 on a single wire that:
 - is restricted to 2 voltage levels HI/LO, i.e. is a digital output, and
 - the level cannot change in less than 1 ms.

2. Suppose you have a set of 8 switches, labeled 0-7, and you want to transmit the switch label to another circuit when it is pressed.  Does your scheme from the previous question need any modifications to handle this scenario?

3. Suppose that your power supply is noisy and this causes a HI/LO output level to be incorrectly detected by the other circuit.  How could you modify your transmission scheme to reduce the impact of these errors?
