# Independent Design Project

In this project, you will design, implement and test a project of your own choosing.

Here are the guidelines:
 - Your project must interact with the physical world (sound, light, movement, etc) somehow.
 - Your project must be capable of operating untethered, from a 9VDC supply (or battery), so you cannot rely on serial input or output for the main features (but you are encouraged to use them for development and testing).
 - Your project should be at the prototype stage, so use of a bread board and jumper wires is fine, and you do not need to construct an enclosure.
 - You may use components that are not in your kit, but you are responsible for obtaining them in time.

Your project should require 10-20 hours to build and test once you have all of the components.  If you are currently spending about 8 hours on each project, then aim for something about twice as ambitious.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of projects at the right level:
 - A musical tuner that identifies which note is being played and whether it is sharp or flat.
 - A heart-rate monitor to measure and record beats per minute.
 - An air quality monitoring station similar to [this one](https://www2.purpleair.com/collections/air-quality-sensors/products/purpleair-pa-ii) from PurpleAir.
 - A wireless communication system that transmits data via sound.
 - An ambient light monitor that distinguishes between types of lighting: sunlight, fluorescent and incandescent.

The [hack-a-day site](https://hackaday.com/) is generally a good source of inspiration for projects like this.

## Phase 1: Project Definition

1. Describe what your design is intended to accomplish. This should be a brief high-level description that explains how the design interacts with the physical world, without referring to specific electronics components.

2. Describe the key electronic components that you expect your design will require. If any key components are not in your kit, provide a link to a product page or datasheet.

3. Describe your testing plan, broken down into 2-4 steps.  Each step should clearly describe the purpose, test setup, sequence of operations, and expected outcomes. Taken together, the steps should demonstrate that design accomplishes what you described in part 1.

4. Make a diagram or sketch showing what your project might look like in use as a finished product.  Think carefully about a realistic size and enclosure.  How is it powered?
